# PRIMES_2019

This is my application for [MIT PRIMES](http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program.php) 2019, a free high school research opportunities on CS, Computational Biology, and Math.

To apply for the CS track, you have to solve the [General Math Problems](Math/General%20Math%20Problems.pdf) and the [CS Problems](CS/CS%20Problems.pdf). For each CS problem directory, manually create a `tests` and a `output` folder, or else the program will crash. Use `generate_test_cases` to generate tests once; then comment the code out since it takes a lot of time. Read the CS solutions PDF in conjunction with the code.

The problem sets are not easy, and I spent a lot of time and had a lot of fun working on them. No matter if I get in, I still learned a great deal from it. Well, I also missed my deadline by 10 minutes, so perhaps I will be disqualified, but we shall see.
